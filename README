Analyze This is a solution to the problem of trying to preview a link from within a browser - like facebook's "share a link" feature.

oEmbed and oohEmbed try to solve the problem of a how a url should be represented on a page. For example, if it's a flickr photo url,
the thumbnail can be shown, if the url is a youtube video, a player should be embedded and so on. The problem with oEmbed and oohEmbed
is that the list of supported websites is limited.

Analyze This on the other hand tends to handle webpages in a generic way by providing data that is common on all web pages.
That is: title, description, keywords, and images list.

Given a webpage's url, the application returns a JSON object representing the webpage's info.
The application uses JSONP so that the caller can provide a callback function.

Example
-------
Say that we're running this application at http://www.analyzethis.com/ and we have another application at http://www.another.com,
A page on another.com gives the user the option to enter a url and preview it.
That page doesn't want to bother its server with that and it needs to use a remote service for that. Due to cross site AJAX limitations,
the page can't call the analyzethis.com service directly. It has to do so via a script tag and it provides a callback function.

<script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.analyzethis.com/analyze_this?url=SOME_URL"></script>
